## Overview

### The challenge

This is a perfect challenge to test your layout skills. The card layout doesn't shift, so it's also great for those that haven't dived into responsive websites yet!

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox for layout and how to make the design responsive using media queries. I also practiced using CSS variables to manage colors and other design properties.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to continue improving my skills in responsive design and explore more advanced CSS techniques. I also aim to enhance accessibility features in my projects.
